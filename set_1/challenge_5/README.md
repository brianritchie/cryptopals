# Challenge 5 Write-up

The challenge specifies we need to take a string given and encrypt it using the key "ICE" and the repeating-key XOR method.

This is actually quite straightforward ot achieve given the previous challenges. The only trick was to make sure the position of the bytes in the key matched the position evaluated fro the source string.
